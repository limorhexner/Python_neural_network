# Python_neural_network
Neural network Python implementation

This code use neural network to learn and predict digits from image
Input samples of the code are 1X400 vectors, each vector represent 20X20 BW image of a hand written digit
Output samples are labels of each vector

the code has 2 objects:
  dataSet: holds all the data available for a specific set of input samples
  neuralNerwork: holds the network parameters and information about the data used for training
Connection between the objects and the other functions are described in doc.pdf file
